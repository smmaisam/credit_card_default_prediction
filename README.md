# credit_card_default_prediction
Summary:
This project aims to employ different classification models to accurately predict credit card default. For this purpose, we have sourced the dataset from Kaggle
that contains information on Taiwanese credit card clients. The project aims to identify relationships between multiple demographic and financial variables with default risk. Leveraging multiple machine learning algorithms to predict credit card defaults enabling the financial institutions and intermediaries to reduce risk and achieve maximum profits. Reflections include fine tuning of the models and include further possibilities of model expansion. In the end, research findings add to the data driven management strategies to mitigate risks.   

Following Methodlogy has been adopted to complete this project:

• Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain deeper understanding and underlying patterns in the Data.
• Correlation matrix to sense which features are most suitable for the Model as a whole.
• Data Cleaning, Filtering and Transformations.
• Feature Engineering to generate input for the Model.
• Standardization of the features/variables to get better results.
• Synthetic Minority Oversampling (SMOTE) to solve problems of Overfitting.
• Classification Algorithms such as KNN, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost with best hyperparameters to classify Defaulters and Non-Defaulters
• Predicting Probability of Default
• Drawing Feature Importance and other plots to make a statement.
